 How to Use
1. Save the script as deploy_all.sh

2. Make it executable: chmod +x deploy_all.sh

3. Run it:  ./deploy_all.sh

  The script will:
-  Detect your username.
-  Create all required folders.
-  Drop the correct docker-compose.yml in each toolâ€™s directory.
-  Spin up each container.

ðŸ’¡ Advantages of this approach:

    No hardcoding of usernames â€” works for whoever runs it.

    Separation of projects â€” each tool is self-contained with configs.

    Persistence â€” configs survive container restarts.

    One-command deployment â€” easy to re-run or modify.
