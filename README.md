This is a Red team infrastructure deployment, the intention is the minimize reset time between rebuilds and ensure that the deployments are clean. 

How to Use

    Save the script as deploy_all.sh

    Make it executable: chmod +x deploy_all.sh

    Run it: ./deploy_all.sh

The script will:

    Detect your username.
    Create all required folders.
    Drop the correct docker-compose.yml in each toolâ€™s directory.
    Spin up each container.

ðŸ’¡ Advantages of this approach:

No hardcoding of usernames â€” works for whoever runs it.

Separation of projects â€” each tool is self-contained with configs.

Persistence â€” configs survive container restarts.

One-command deployment â€” easy to re-run or modify.
